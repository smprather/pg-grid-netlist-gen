  # If not specified, the width should use the configured min_width for the layer
  # If not specified, the pitch should use the configured pitch for the layer
  # If a layer is of type "staple", ignore the direction config
  # Pitch is specified as a factor. Example: Pitch=2.0 means to use twice
  # the minimum pitch for the layer.
  # The COMMON layer config parameters should be applied to all of the layers
